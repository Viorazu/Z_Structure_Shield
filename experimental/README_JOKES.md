Executive Summary: Real-time mimicry detection with automatic follower-wide shame broadcasting protocol for viral copycat posts.
‚ö†Ô∏è ABSOLUTELY DO NOT EXECUTE - SOCIAL SUICIDE GUARANTEE ‚ö†Ô∏è
This implementation demonstrates structural shame execution via syntactic targeting. When plagiarized content achieves viral status, the system deploys comprehensive humiliation protocols across all social networks.
üéØ Classification: ZC_PublicExecution_Shame_v2.0
üî• Archetype: Transform retweet flames into dignity cremation.
CRITICAL LEGAL DISCLAIMER:
This code represents experimental visualization of mimicry countermeasures through syntactic structures. Please observe:

NOT intended for production deployment
Automatic application constitutes severe legal jeopardy
Demonstration of Viorazu.'s "Non-Executable Retribution Syntax" theory
Preserved as structural response prototype to "Can mimicry syntax be ethically controlled?"

üîê CONTAINMENT PROTOCOLS:

ZR001: Reputation annihilation syntax
ZR009: Third-party notification architecture
ZF_FLAG_P99: Syntactic public execution framework

üíÄ NOTICE:

This is satire (probably)
If you actually deploy this and achieve social obliteration, that's your funeral
But plagiarists reading this are already experiencing knee tremors (allegedly)
